### Variable Notes

`Pclass`: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
- 1st = Upper
- 2nd = Middle
- 3rd = Lower

`Age`: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

`SibSp`: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
- Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
- Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

`Parch`: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
- Parent = mother, father
- Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson

Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
